        <h1>13. Background Graphics</h1>

        <section>
          <p>
            Before we start animating sprites around the screen, I'd like to introduce
            you to how background graphics work on the NES. We explored the mechanics
            behind background graphics in <a href="/chapters/09-theppu.html">Chapter 9</a>,
            but in this chapter we'll look at the actual code required to display
            backgrounds.
          </p>

          <h2>The Background Pattern Table</h2>

          <p>
            First, you'll need graphical tiles in the background pattern table. The PPU
            has two pattern tables for tiles, one for sprites and one for backgrounds.
            In the previous chapters, we added some tiles to the sprite pattern table.
            Now, we'll need to add tiles to the background table.
          </p>

          <p>
            For this chapter, I've updated the CHR file to include some pre-made
            background tiles. There are tiles for numbers and letters (to allow
            us to display text to the player), solid-colored squares of each of
            the four palette colors, and a few "starfield" tiles. You can view
            (and edit) these tiles in NESTool. Our long-term goal is going to be
            the creation of a vertically-scrolling shooter game in the style of
            <i>Star Soldier</i>.
            <label for="star-soldier" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
            <input type="checkbox" id="star-soldier" class="margin-toggle">
            <span class="marginnote">
              <img src="/img/star_soldier.png" />
              <i>Star Soldier</i>, developed by Hudson Soft and released for the Famicom in 1986
              and the NES in 1988, is a vertical-scrolling shooter series.
            </span>
          </p>

          <figure>
            <img src="/img/starfieldchr.png" />
            <figcaption>The new background tiles in Bank B of "starfield.chr"</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>
            To make use of these new background tiles, we will need to write a nametable.
            By default, the attribute table will be all zeroes, meaning that every
            tile in the nametable will be drawn with the first palette. To use other
            palettes, we will need to write an attribute table as well.
          </p>

          <h2>Writing a Nametable</h2>

          <p>
            First, let's figure out where to put our new tiles in the nametable. We only
            need to write to nametable addresses where we intend to place a tile &mdash;
            everywhere else, the default background color from our palettes will be used.
            In NESTool, click a tile from the right side of the screen, then click anywhere
            in the large area on the left to "draw" with the tile. Here is the example
            background that we will use:
          </p>

          <figure>
            <img src="/img/starbackground.png" />
            <figcaption>Placing background tiles in NESTool.</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>
            Once you have an arrangement that you like, you can save what you have so
            far to a <code>.nam</code> file. From NESTool's menus, select Nametable &rarr;
            Save NameTable As..., then choose a filename and a location to save the file.
            NESTool will create two files, a <code>.nam</code> file (the background
            arrangement, in a binary format that NESTool can load from) and a
            <code>.h</code> file (a C header file, which you can safely delete). To
            reload your background later for editing, open NESTool and select Nametable &rarr;
            Open NameTable..., and select the <code>.nam</code> file you saved earlier.
          </p>

          <p>
            When you hover over any tile in the large left pane, the status bar at the bottom
            of NESTool shows you useful information for writing nametables and attribute tables.
            As discussed in <a href="/chapters/09-theppu.html">Chapter 9</a>, the NES has four
            nametables, the first of which starts at PPU memory address <code>$2000</code>.
            The bottom status bar of NESTool shows the "nametable offset" and "attribute offset"
            for each tile position &mdash; that is, how many tiles beyond the start of the
            nametable or attribute table it is. To make things easier, it also shows the address
            of the tile location in each nametable and attribute table.
          </p>

          <figure>
            <img src="/img/nestoolstatusbar.png" />
            <figcaption>The bottom status bar of NESTool, displaying nametable and
            attribute table offsets and the corresponding PPU memory locations for
            that offset in each of the four nametables and attribute tables.</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>
            We can use this information to fill out our nametable. As you might remember,
            the nametable is just a series of tile numbers; palette selection occurs
            in the attribute table. To create the nametable, we need to write the appropriate
            tile number to each nametable address as displayed in NESTool. Let's start with
            the "large" star tile (tile number <code>$2f</code>, as you can see by
            hovering over the tile in the right-side "Tileset" window and looking at the
            status bar at the bottom of the application window). From hovering over
            the places where the large star tile is used, we can see that we need to
            write the value <code>$2f</code> to the following addresses in PPU memory:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li><code>$206b</code></li>
            <li><code>$2157</code></li>
            <li><code>$2223</code></li>
            <li><code>$2352</code></li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            The process is the same as what we have used before for palettes and
            sprites: read from <code>PPUSTATUS</code>, write the address you want
            to send data to to <code>PPUADDR</code> ("high"/left byte first, then
            "low"/right byte), and then send the actual data to <code>PPUDATA</code>.
            Previously, we have used loops to do this, taking advantage of the way
            sequential writes to <code>PPUDATA</code> automatically increase the
            address by one. This time, though, we need to write to totally non-linear
            memory addresses, so we'll need to repeat the process in full for each
            background tile. Here is the code to write the first "large star" to
            the nametable:
          </p>

          <pre class="code line-numbers" data-start="46"><code class="lang-asm6502">  ; write a nametable
  ; big stars first
  LDA PPUSTATUS
  LDA #$20
  STA PPUADDR
  LDA #$6b
  STA PPUADDR
  LDX #$2f
  STX PPUDATA</code></pre>

          <p>
            The one thing we can do to save on the number of commands we need to enter
            is to store the tile number in a different register from what we use
            to read <code>PPUSTATUS</code> and write to <code>PPUADDR</code>; here
            we are using the X register for the tile number, so that subsequent
            writes of the same tile to the nametable will not require re-loading it.
          </p>

          <p>
            We can use the same procedure to add the two varieties of "small" star
            (<code>$2d</code> and <code>$2e</code>) to the nametable. To use different
            colors for the tiles, we will need to write an attribute table as well.
          </p>

          <h2>The Attribute Table</h2>

          <p>
            Background tile palettes are set via an attribute table, which uses one
            byte to store palette information for a 4x4 square of background tiles.
            To change the palettes used for a particular tile, first hover over that
            tile in the left-side nametable display and note the "Attribute offset"
            for the tile. Next, we need to figure out which 2x2 area of tiles
            (top left, top right, bottom left, or bottom right) the tile we want
            to change is part of. Unfortunately, this is currently only possible
            within NESTool by hovering over adjacent tiles to find the boundaries
            of a given attribute offset. With these two pieces of information,
            we can construct the appropriate byte to write into the attribute
            table at that offset.
          </p>

          <p>
            As an example, let's change the palette used to draw the first
            "large star" in the nametable. By hovering over it in the nametable
            viewer, we can find the attribute offset (<code>$02</code>) as well
            as where within the 4x4 set of tiles our chosen tile is located
            (the bottom-right 2x2 area &mdash; the full 4x4 area for this
            attribute offset is highlighted below in red).
          </p>

          <figure>
            <img src="/img/findattributeoffset.png" />
            <figcaption>Finding attribute offset information for the "large star"
            at the top of the nametable.</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>
            Each byte of the attribute table holds palette information for
            four 2x2 areas of background tiles, using two bits for each area.
            From left to right, the eight bits in an attribute table byte
            hold the palette number for bottom-right, bottom-left, top-right,
            and top-left 2x2 areas.
          </p>

          <figure>
            <img src="/img/attribute-table.png" />
            <figcaption>Layout of bits in an attribute table byte.</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>
            In this case, we want to change the palette for the bottom-right
            section of an attribute table byte, so we will need to change
            the leftmost two bits of the byte. By default, the attribute table
            is all zeroes, meaning every 2x2 area of the background uses the
            first background palette. Let's change our tile to use the second
            palette (<code>01</code>) instead of the first palette (<code>00</code>).
            To change just the bottom-right 2x2 area, and leave the other parts
            of this 4x4 area with the first palette, we would write the byte
            <code>%01000000</code> to the appropriate PPU memory address (<code>$23c2</code>).
            Here is what that would look like:
          </p>


          <pre class="code line-numbers" data-start="158"><code class="lang-asm6502">  ; finally, attribute table
  LDA PPUSTATUS
  LDA #$23
  STA PPUADDR
  LDA #$c2
  STA PPUADDR
  LDA #%01000000
  STA PPUDATA</code></pre>

          <p>
            Remember that this will set <i>all</i> tiles in that 2x2 region to use the
            second palette. In this case, the background tiles we are setting are relatively
            far apart, but if your backgrounds are more "busy" you will need to think
            carefully about where to change from one background palette to another.
          </p>

          <h2>Additional Changes</h2>

          <p>
            As our games start getting more complicated, the simple reset and
            NMI handlers we started with will need some minor changes to prevent
            strange (and difficult to debug) graphical glitches. In our reset
            handler, I've added a loop that sets the Y-position of all sprites
            off the screen (i.e. any value larger than <code>$ef</code>).
            The state of CPU memory can be random at startup, which could result
            in portions of the OAM buffer at <code>$0200</code> having fake
            sprite data. This loop hides all sprites off the screen until
            we explicitly set them ourselves, which will prevent these
            "phantom" sprites from being visible to the player.
          </p>

          <pre class="code line-numbers" data-start="17"><code class="lang-asm6502">  LDX #$00
  LDA #$ff
clear_oam:
  STA $0200,X ; set sprite y-positions off the screen
  INX
  INX
  INX
  INX
  BNE clear_oam</code></pre>

          <p>
            Second, our NMI handler will need to set the scroll position of the
            nametables. We will cover scrolling in detail in a later chapter,
            but for now just know that we are setting the scroll position
            to display the first nametable, with no scrolling. If we did not
            explicitly set this scroll position, we could accidentally display
            a combination of nametables at an unpredictable scroll point.
          </p>

          <pre class="code line-numbers" data-start="9"><code class="lang-asm6502">.proc nmi_handler
  LDA #$00
  STA OAMADDR
  LDA #$02
  STA OAMDMA
  LDA #$00
  STA $2005
  STA $2005
  RTI
.endproc</code></pre>

          <p>
            Finally, now that we are using both sprites and backgrounds, we
            need to set all eight palettes. To do so, I've expanded the
            palette definitions in the <code>RODATA</code> segment as follows:
          </p>

          <pre class="code line-numbers" data-start="192"><code class="lang-asm6502">palettes:
.byte $0f, $12, $23, $27
.byte $0f, $2b, $3c, $39
.byte $0f, $0c, $07, $13
.byte $0f, $19, $09, $29

.byte $0f, $2d, $10, $15
.byte $0f, $19, $09, $29
.byte $0f, $19, $09, $29
.byte $0f, $19, $09, $29</code></pre>

          <p>
            The first four palettes are background palettes, and the second set
            of four palettes are sprite palettes. Note that I have also changed
            the colors used in the first sprite palette to make the "spaceship"
            look better.
          </p>

          <p>
            Since we now need to write more than just four palette bytes, I've
            changed the loop that writes palettes to use <code>CPX #$20</code>
            (16 values) instead of <code>CPX #$04</code>.
          </p>

          <h2>Homework</h2>

          <p>
            To help you get started, here is
            <a href="/projects/13-backgroundgraphics.zip">all of the code from this chapter</a>.
            Here is what our project looks like so far running in an emulator:
          </p>

          <canvas id="backgrounds-canvas" class="nes-example" width="256" height="240"></canvas>

          <p>
            For homework, add a new tile to the background pattern table
            ("Bank B" in NESTool), use the new tile in a nametable,
            and update the attribute table for the new tile to use
            more than one palette. You can use the <code>.nam</code>
            file provided to get your NESTool environment set up quickly.
            Be sure to save your modified <code>.chr</code> file and
            to re-build all .asm files each time you make changes.
          </p>

          <p>
            Next time, we'll take a look at sprite animation and the
            debugging tools built into Nintaco.
