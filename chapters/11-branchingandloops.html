        <section>
          <p>
            At the end of the last chapter, we successfully drew a single sprite to the screen,
            but doing so took a large amount of code. In this chapter, we will learn some new
            assembly opcodes that will help us separate data from logic and, as a side effect,
            make our code much more efficient and easier to read and reason about.
          </p>

          <h2>Flow Control in Assembly</h2>

          <p>
            With the exception of <code>JMP</code>, all of the assembly we have seen so far
            has been completely linear: the processor reads a byte from the next memory address
            and processes it, moving from the start of our ROM file to the end. <i>Flow control</i>
            refers to the ability to write code that can evaluate certain conditions and
            change which code will be executed next based on the result. For the 6502, there
            are two forms of flow control. <code>JMP</code> is an "unconditional" <i>jump</i>
            to a different point in the ROM (it does not perform any kind of test or evaluation).
            The other form of flow control is called "branching", because it performs a test
            and then moves to one of two different "branches" of code based on the result.
          </p>

          <h3>The Processor Status Register</h3>

          <p>
            The key to branching is a part of the 6502 called the <i>processor status register</i>,
            often referred to as <code>P</code>. The status register, like all other 6502 registers,
            is eight bits in size. Unlike the other registers, the status register is not directly
            accessible to the programmer. Each time the processor performs an operation, the status
            register changes to reflect the results of that operation. Each bit in the status register
            gives information about a particular aspect of the last operation.
          </p>

          <figure>
            <img src="/img/processorstatus.png">
            <figcaption>The eight bits of the processor status register (NV-BDIZC).</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>
            For our purposes, the two most important bits (or "flags") of the processor status register are the
            <code>Z</code> ("zero") and <code>C</code> ("carry") bits. The zero flag is <i>set</i>
            (1) if the result of the last operation was zero. The zero flag is <i>cleared</i> (0) if
            the result of the last operation was anything but zero. Similarly, the carry flag is set
            if the result of the last operation caused a "carry", and cleared otherwise.
          </p>

          <h3>Carrying</h3>

          <p>
            While the zero flag is straightforward, the carry flag requires some additional explanation.
            Consider what happens when we add the decimal numbers 13 and 29. If we were to perform this
            addition by hand, we would first add the "3" from 13 to the "9" from 29. The result is 12,
            which is too large to fit into a single decimal digit. So, we write down a "2" and <i>carry over</i>
            the "1" into the next column to the left. Here, we add together the "1" from 13, the "2" from 29,
            and the "1" that we carried over. The result is 4, which we write down under that column, for
            a total of 42.
          </p>

          <p>
            The carry flag on the 6502 performs the same function, but for bytes. An addition operation will
            result in the carry flag being set if the result of the addition is larger than what can fit
            in one byte (i.e. if the result is greater than 255).  We will generally use an opcode that
            force-clears the carry flag before performing an addition, to avoid having a carry set by
            a previous operation persist to the current addition.
            <label for="when-to-persist-carry" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
            <input type="checkbox" id="when-to-persist-carry" class="margin-toggle">
            <span class="marginnote">
              Why would you ever want to persist a previous carry flag before performing an addition?
              <i>Not </i> clearing the carry flag allows you to add together multi-byte numbers, by first
              adding the lowest bytes of the two numbers and letting that addition set the carry
              flag if needed. When you add the next-lowest bytes of the two numbers, the carry flag
              will automatically be added in.
            </span>
          </p>

          <p>
            Subtraction works similarly to addition, except that we will generally <i>set</i> the
            carry flag before performing a subtraction. A subtraction operation results in the carry
            flag being <i>cleared</i> if the number being subtracted is larger than the number it is being
            subtracted from. As an example, if we subtract 17 from 15, the result is -2. This number is less
            than zero, so in order to carry out the subtraction we need to "borrow" from the next-lowest
            column, using up the carry flag that we set before starting the subtraction.
          </p>

          <p>
            It is important to note here that much like single-digit decimal numbers, bytes "wrap around"
            when adding beyond 255 or subtracting beyond zero. If a byte (or register, or memory value) is
            currently at 253 and you add 7, the result is not 260 &mdash; it is 4, with the carry flag set.
            Similarly, if a byte's value is 4 and you subtract 7, the result is 253 with a cleared carry flag,
            not -3.
          </p>

          <p>
            We will cover how to actually perform addition and subtraction in a later chapter; for now,
            all you need to know is that the instructions the processor executes will change the values
            of the zero and carry flags in the processor status register.
          </p>

          <h2>Branching</h2>

          <p>
            Now that you know about the processor status register, we can use the results of operations
            to branch to different parts of our code. The simplest way to use branching is to build a
            loop that does something 256 times. In its most basic form, it looks like this:
          </p>

          <pre class="code line-numbers"><code class="lang-asm6502">  LDX #$00
LoopStart:
  ; do something
  INX
  BNE LoopStart
  ; end of loop</code></pre>

          <p>
            Before we look at how the loop actually works, there are two new opcodes here to discuss.
            <code>INX</code> stands for "increment X"; it adds one to the value of the X register
            and stores it back in the X register. <code>BNE</code> stands for "Branch if Not Equal
            to zero"; it changes the normal flow of code execution if the zero flag in the processor
            status register is cleared (i.e., the result of the last operation was not zero).
          </p>

          <p>
            The loop begins by loading the immediate value <code>$00</code> into the X register.
            Next, we have a label (<code>LoopStart</code>), which will be used by our branching
            instruction at the end of the loop. After the label, we do whatever it is that we
            want our loop to perform, then we increment the X register. Like all math-related
            operations, this will update the flags in the processor status register. The final
            line of the loop checks the value of the zero flag. If the zero flag is set, nothing
            special happens &mdash; the program just keeps on running, with whatever comes after
            <code>; end of loop</code> being executed next. If the zero flag is cleared, then
            <code>BNE LoopStart</code> tells the processor to find the <code>LoopStart</code>
            label and execute whatever is located there next instead &mdash; in other words,
            running the next iteration of the loop.
          </p>

          <p>
            In actual operation, this loop will run 256 times. On the first iteration of the loop,
            the value of the X register is zero. After <code>INX</code>, the value of the X register
            is one. Since the result of <code>INX</code> was not a zero, the zero flag will be
            cleared. When we get to <code>BNE LoopStart</code>, because the zero flag is cleared,
            the processor will go back to the <code>LoopStart</code> label and run through the loop
            again. This time, the X register will become two, which is still not zero, and the loop
            will run again. Eventually, the X register's value will be 255. When we run <code>INX</code>
            this time, the X register will "roll over" to zero, and the carry flag will be set.
            <label for="zero-or-carry" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
            <input type="checkbox" id="zero-or-carry" class="margin-toggle">
            <span class="marginnote">
              Note that in this case, we could have branched based on either the zero flag
              or the carry flag. When the X register "rolls over" from 255 to 0, both
              the zero and carry flags will be set.
            </span>
            Now that the last operation resulted in a zero, <code>BNE LoopStart</code> will no
            longer be triggered, and the processor will continue on to whatever comes after the
            loop.
          </p>

          <p>
            There is one more thing to note here before we move on. After running this code
            through our assembler and linker, all of our labels (like <code>LoopStart</code>)
            will be stripped out and replaced with actual memory addresses. To ensure that
            branches do not take up an undue amount of processor time, the data that follows
            a branch command is not a memory address but a signed one-byte number that is added
            to whatever memory address is in the program counter. As a result, the code you
            want to branch to must be less than 127 bytes before, or less than 128 bytes after,
            your branch instruction. If you need to branch to something that is further away,
            you'll need to <code>JMP</code> to that label instead. This is probably not going
            to be a common occurrence unless you are writing fairly complicated code, but
            it's an interesting implementation detail that might lead to a hard-to-track-down
            bug somewhere down the line.
          </p>

          <h2>A Review of Looping/Branching Opcodes</h2>

          <p>
            We've already seen <code>INX</code> and <code>BNE</code>, but these are only two
            of the opcodes that you are likely to use for creating loops. Let's look at
            the ten new opcodes that you should add to your toolset.
          </p>

          <h3>Incrementing and Decrementing Opcodes</h3>

          <p>
            These opcodes allow you to add or subtract by one in a single opcode. There is
            no need to explicitly set or clear the carry flag before using one of these opcodes.
          </p>

          <p>
            <code>INX</code> and <code>INY</code> will add one to ("increment") the X or Y
            register, respectively.  In the opposite direction, <code>DEX</code> and
            <code>DEY</code> will subtract one from ("decrement") the X or Y register.
            Finally, you can use <code>INC</code> and <code>DEC</code> to increment
            or decrement the contents of a memory address. As an example, you could
            use <code>INC $05</code> to add one to whatever is stored at memory address
            <code>$05</code>, and store the result back in <code>$05</code>.
          </p>

          <p>
            All of the increment/decrement opcodes will update the values of the
            zero and carry flags of the processor status register.
          </p>

          <h3>Branching Opcodes</h3>

          <p>
            There are branching opcodes for each flag of the processor status register.
            Each flag has two opcodes - one that branches if the flag is set, and one
            that branches if the flag is cleared. For our purposes, the only branching
            opcodes you will need to use check the values of the zero and carry flags.
          </p>

          <p>
            <code>BEQ</code> ("Branch if Equals zero") and <code>BNE</code> ("Branch if
            Not Equals zero") will change the flow of the program if the zero flag is
            set or cleared, respectively. <code>BCS</code> ("Branch if Carry Set") and
            <code>BCC</code> ("Branch if Carry Cleared") do the same for the carry flag.
            What follows each opcode should generally be a label for what code should
            be executed next if the branching opcode's conditions are met.
          </p>

          <h2>Another Branching Example</h2>

          <p>
            I'd like to present one more example of branching. This time, our loop
            will run eight times instead of 256.
          </p>

          <pre class="code line-numbers"><code class="lang-asm6502">  LDY #$08
LoopTwo:
  ; do something
  DEY
  BNE LoopTwo
  ; end of loop</code></pre>

          <p>
            As in the previous loop example, here we first set up the pre-conditions
            of our loop by setting the Y register to <code>$08</code>. Then we have
            the label that our branching opcode will use later. After we've done
            whatever it is that we want our loop to do on each iteration, we decrement
            the Y register and then branch back to the start of the loop if the zero flag
            is cleared.
          </p>

          <p>
            In a more modern, C-like programming language (such as JavaScript), this entire
            loop could be re-written as follows:
          </p>

          <pre class="code line-numbers"><code>for (y = 8; y != 0; y--) {
  // do something
}</code></pre>

          <h2>Making Comparisons</h2>

          <p>
            While the loops we have seen so far are useful, they require some careful setup.
            The loops above rely on our loop counter becoming zero in order to end the loop.
            To make more flexible and powerful loops, we need the ability to make
            arbitrary comparisons. In 6502 assembly, the opcodes that let us do that
            are <code>CMP</code>, "Compare (with accumulator)", <code>CPX</code>, "Compare
            with X register", and <code>CPY</code>, "Compare with Y register".
          </p>

          <p>
            Each of these opcodes works by performing a subtraction, setting the zero
            and carry flags as appropriate, and then discarding the result of the
            subtraction. Remember that when we perform a subtraction, we first
            set the carry flag. This means that we have three possible outcomes
            from a comparison, based on the register value and the value we are comparing
            it to:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li><i>Register is larger than comparison value</i>: Carry flag set, zero flag clear</li>
            <li><i>Register is equal to comparison value</i>: Carry flag set, zero flag set</li>
            <li><i>Register is smaller than comparison value</i>: Carry flag clear, zero flag clear</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            We can use this information to create more complicated program logic. Consider the case
            where we load a value from memory and then check whether it is greater than, equal to,
            or less than <code>$80</code>.
          </p>

          <pre class="code line-numbers"><code class="lang-asm6502">  LDA $06
  CMP #$80
  BEQ reg_was_80
  BCS reg_gt_80
  ; neither branch taken; register less than $80
  ; do something here
  JMP done_with_comparison ; jump to skip branch-specific code
reg_was_80:
  ; register equalled $80
  ; do something here
  JMP done_with_comparison ; skip the following branch
reg_gt_80:
  ; register was greater than $80
  ; do something here
  ; no need to jump because done_With_comparison is next
done_with_comparison:
  ; continue with rest of the program</code></pre>

          <p>
            This kind of three-way branch is fairly common. Note the presence of
            a label to mark the end of all branch code, so that earlier code
            can <code>JMP</code> over branch-specific code that shouldn't be
            executed if the branch was not taken.
          </p>

          <h2>Using Comparisons in Loops</h2>

          <p>
            To close out this chapter, let's take a look at how comparisons can
            be used to create more sophisticated loops. Here is a loop that
            runs eight times, but counts up from zero instead of counting
            down from eight.
          </p>

          <pre class="code line-numbers"><code class="lang-asm6502">  LDX #$00
loop_start:
  ; do something
  INX
  CPX #$08
  BNE loop_start
  ; loop is finished here</code></pre>

          <p>
            Here, we set the X register to zero before starting our loop. After each
            loop iteration, we increment the X register and then compare X to
            <code>$08</code>. If the X register does not equal eight, the zero
            flag will not be set, and we will go back to <code>loop_start</code>.
            Otherwise, the <code>CPX</code> will set the zero flag (because eight
            minus eight equals zero), and the loop will be finished.
          </p>

          <p>
            To review, in this chapter we learned the following opcodes:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li><code>INX</code></li>
            <li><code>INY</code></li>
            <li><code>INC</code></li>
            <li><code>DEX</code></li>
            <li><code>DEY</code></li>
            <li><code>DEC</code></li>
            <li><code>BNE</code></li>
            <li><code>BEQ</code></li>
            <li><code>BCC</code></li>
            <li><code>BCS</code></li>
            <li><code>CMP</code></li>
            <li><code>CPX</code></li>
            <li><code>CPY</code></li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            That's 13 more opcodes to add to your toolset!
          </p>

          <p>
            Next chapter, we will re-factor our code to take advantage
            of loops and comparisons, in preparation for creating
            background graphics.
